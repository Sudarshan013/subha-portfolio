          Visual design is one of my favorite parts of designing learning
          experiences. Throughout my learning experience designer (LXD) journey,
          I have seen common visual design mistakes in some initial work
          I&#x27;ve looked at and even in my own work. This sparked the idea to
          create Principles of Design for Instructional Designers!

            <p class="writeup-text withspace">
              Could you look up design principles on Google? Sure... but most
              websites are specific to web design. What about eLearning?
              I&#x27;ve got you covered! In my learning module, I define each
              design principle and show an example of a simple tab interaction
              with opportunities to learn more about each design principle. It’s
              also frustrating when you finally find a resource that covers what
              you’re looking for, but the information is outdated and the links
              to resources no longer work. I address this issue by implementing
              xAPI to collect data on user interactions and experience.

        <p class="writeup-text">
          I wanted this eLearning experience to be useful and effective so I
          created a quick storyboard, designed visual mockups, and developed a
          prototype. After receiving feedback and deciding on a final design, I
          developed a functional and aesthetic final product.

        <h4 class="heading-14">Design</h4>
        <p class="writeup-text">
          Based on the eLearning experiences I’ve reviewed, I discovered there
          were common visual design mistakes being made. This helped me narrow
          down my focus to these nine principles of design: modularity, balance,
          space, alignment, hierarchy, grouping, consistency, dominance, and
          contrast. With these principles in mind, I created a simple storyboard
          to lay out how I would define each principle, how to highlight that
          principle for eLearning, and what resources I wanted to use.

        <h4 class="heading-15">Visual Mockups</h4>
        <p class="writeup-text">
          With the storyboard complete, I moved on to creating the visuals.
          Since I was creating a learning module on visual design, I knew I
          needed to ensure that my project and the simple slide example image
          followed every principle of design. In my first round of wireframes, I
          included the design principle explanation, a good example of a slide,
          and a bad example of a slide. This allowed me to highlight some
          aspects of my storyboard, but it wasn’t obvious what the user was
          looking for.

          In the second round of wireframes, I played around with the idea of
          using a computer screen to display the information. I struggled to
          find a nice visual balance with this layout and I felt that there was
          valuable space being wasted. From this round, I did like the example
          and nonexample slides that I designed.

          With a solid example slide, I was inspired to use the colors in the
          image. This led to the first round of high-fidelity visual mockups.
          Feeling confident with this design, I threw the mockups to the ID
          community to get preferences and overall feedback. I did this in a
          live call with one veteran instructional designer and a handful of
          up-and-coming instructional designers. I also sent out a survey to the
          wider instructional design community.

          The survey results helped me to determine which title slide and quote
          slide were more visually appealing. I also designed multiple options
          for the example slide image and the “+” markers.<br /><br />I
          developed a prototype in Storyline, but I wasn’t satisfied with the
          layout of the content slides. I went back to Figma and created a menu
          slide to free up some space on the content slides. I made sure to
          consider the feedback I received from my survey while creating a
          balanced layout.

          Next, I developed the interactive prototype in Articulate Storyline
          360 to get feedback on the new design and functionality. The menu uses
          gifs for the hover state so it was important to check that these were
          working correctly. The prototype also helped to check that the
          variables I set worked to show the user which menu item they already
          visited. <br /><br />I received feedback to make the “+” markers
          larger and to make the flashing glow less subtle. After receiving this
          feedback, I moved from using Storyline’s built-in markers to creating
          custom markers and custom glow features. This change caused me to
          rebuild the project using more slides, layers to create the glow
          feature loop, and to animate the text boxes for the additional
          information. This rebuild was pretty quick because all of the content
          was already designed; it was just a matter of moving things
          around. <br /><br />Creating the interactive prototype was a crucial
          part of project development. This step helped me develop essential
          features that improved the user interface and user experience.

          Writing code and implementing it in Storyline was thrilling and
          motivating. There was a build-up of anticipation each time I would
          test the code. It was exciting to see when it worked and it was
          exciting to problem-solve when the code didn’t work. I was able to
          successfully track what slides users viewed, what links the user
          visited, and if the user left feedback by selecting a thumbs-up or
          thumbs-down icon. I was also able to collect in-depth feedback from
          the user by pulling their text response from Storyline.<br /><br />All
          of the data collected was sent to Veracity LRS. With this LRS, I can
          view each interaction, read the text-based responses, and view the
          analytics. Watching the data change as users interact with the
          learning module is really satisfying. I am excited to keep this
          learning module updated based on user data.

          Subhashini has turned what could have easily been a boring,
          traditional tabbed interaction into a more interactive, fully
          developed eLearning experience. Combining a menu feature that allows
          flexible progression through the sections of information with cleverly
          thought-out hotspots to avoid cognitive overload was an insightful
          strategy. And Subhashini&#x27;s work is always so beautifully
          designed, which truly enhances the experience. Many visual design
          tutorials focus on web design, but Subhashini has created a learning
          experience for a population who is just as in need of this knowledge:
          eLearning designers. What a helpful tool to have open in a browser tab

          After completing this project I not only feel very confident in my
          ability to develop learning experiences in Articulate Storyline 360,
          but I am also excited to continue exploring xAPI. There were times
          during development when Storyline didn’t play nicely with my design.
          Instead of caving to the limitations, I made Storyline work for me. I
          want to continue learning more about xAPI and all the things it can
          do. <br /><br />This project was fun to work on because I was able to
          flex my visual design skills and knowledge not only in the content
          provided but also in the design of the project.
